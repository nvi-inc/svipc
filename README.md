# Pure Go SysV IPC 

[![](https://godoc.org/github.com/nathany/looper?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/nvi-inc/svipc)

This library implements SysV IPC commands on Linux using system calls rather than `cgo`.

Shared memory access is implemented and fairly well tested. Semaphores are partially implemented. Messages queues are not yet implemented.

API not yet fixed.
